# CSS art challenge: witchy cat
This is my submission for HackGT's challenge. Originally I was just using CSS, but halfway through I switched to SCSS because the animations I was trying to implement were much easier to work with in SCSS. I was able to create a cat in a witch hat that blinks and continuously swishes its tail. Wind blows to make the hat sway. I know halloween has come and gone, but I thought this would be a fun animated image to create. I ran into a lot of challenges with the tail particularly before I remembered I could nest a bunch of the tail class so it could all swing together instead of manually creating each individual polygon.
